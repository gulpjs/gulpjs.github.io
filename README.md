### Getting started

To get started working on this site you first need to clone this repository

```
$ git clone git://github.com/gulpjs/gulpjs.github.io
```

When you are done making your improvements, create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulpjs.github.io/compare).

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command will first pull down the markdown documentation from the main gulp repository, then starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
